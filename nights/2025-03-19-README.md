## Unusual images?
Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:
+ `ey-uma-S005-R001-C001-B.fit` to `ey-uma-S005-R001-C003-rp.fit` -- not ey-uma
+ `ey-uma-S001-R001-C001-V_dupe-1.fit` -- very faint satellite or plane track in here.

## Missing information?
Check these off if they are true:
- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?
