## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ All M74 images have at least a little bit of clouds, usually a lot of clouds

Delete this list if there are no unusual images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)


If any images are missing information and you have been unable to fix them please list
them below with a short description of the problem.

+ Many M74 iumages have no WCS because it was too cloudy

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?
