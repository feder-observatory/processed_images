## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ DO NOT USE THIS NIGHT! THE DOME DID NOT MOVE! Several images show clear diffraction as the field was partially blocked, and some images are of the inside of the dome.

Delete this list if there are no unusual images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing, just don't use this night.
