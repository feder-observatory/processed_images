## Unusual images?

THIS NIGHT HAS A BUNCH OF PROBLEMS

+ The dome blocked many of the EY UMa images and some of the NGC 891 images.
+ One of the dust flaps did not open.
+ The flats, except for the `gp` filter, were taken in the evening and the morning and they look different from each other.
+ No satellites, though.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

Many images have no astrometry because they pictures of the inside of the dome.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing, this night is not fixable.
